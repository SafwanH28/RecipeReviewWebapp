My personal api was created with Python and Flask
The webapp was created with JavaScript and React

To run my api on windows: 
venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py


To start webapp:
cd recipe-review-web-app/client
npm start


Discuss how the application and api could be extended and improved:

Additional Functionalities for deletion/modifications of existing reviews
Methods to search for existing reviewed recipes
Creation of seperate page for all reviews
The ability to link recipes called from the public apis to reviewed recipes allowing the reviewed recipes to have corresponding pictures and nutritional values.
